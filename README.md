<h1>Project Description</h1>
This Application shows a list of predefined food products with their use by Dates in Years. 
Users can also manually add a Food product of their choice directly to the cart, and in the cart, they can view the added items, remove existing items and also increase the quantity of previously added items.
I used create-react-app to execute the project.
